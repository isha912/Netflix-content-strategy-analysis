# Netflix-content-strategy-analysis
ORGANISATIONAL PROBLEM
Netflix, which has currently evolved to be a globally recognised streaming platform, was once a
DVD rental service. The strategies that enabled it to get here include diversifying content types,
experimenting with international and genre-specific programming, and aligning releases with
user demand & viewing patterns. This project aims to uncover these patterns and forecast the
direction of Netflix’s content evolution.
OVERVIEW
Using a dataset of ~7,787 titles, we analyzed content type distribution, monthly and
yearly release patterns, and genre preferences. We performed extensive feature
engineering for a cleaner analysis, trend visualizations, and time series forecasting
(ARIMA) to predict future content direction as well.
RESULTS
Netflix’s content production boomed between 2015–2020, with a rising share of TV shows
and international genres like anime and British series. Our ARIMA model predicts the
movie ratio will decline from 36% in 2022 to 12% by 2031. Ratings like TV-MA have
surged post-2010, indicating a focus on mature audiences.
CONCLUSION
Netflix is strategically transitioning toward serialized storytelling and diversified genres
to appeal to global markets. Research confirms a decline in movie content. The analysis
highlights how data can be used to study long-term media strategies and how machine
learning can project future trends.
